# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyse customer behaviour data and identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave a service. The insights generated can help organisations improve customer retention and make data-driven business decisions.


## 🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn directly impacts company revenue and growth. Businesses need proactive methods to identify at-risk customers before they leave. This project develops a predictive analytics solution that enables early intervention strategies based on data insights.


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn – Machine learning models
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
SQL – Data querying and extraction
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment 


## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographic and service usage information, including:

Customer tenure
Contract type
Monthly charges
Payment method
Service subscriptions
Churn status (Target Variable)

## 🔎 Methodology

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering

Model Training using:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Model Evaluation and Performance Comparison


## 📊 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	82%
Random Forest	85%

The Random Forest model achieved the best performance and was selected as the final predictive model.


## 📈 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts showed higher churn probability.
Higher monthly charges correlated with increased churn risk.
Long-term customers were significantly less likely to churn.
